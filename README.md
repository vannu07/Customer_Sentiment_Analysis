## General Information
The methodology adopted for the Customer Analysis project followed a systematic approach that ensured the project's success through careful planning, execution, and continuous iteration. This methodology is divided into five key phases: Research, Design, Development, Testing, and Deployment. Each phase contributed to creating a robust and efficient system for analyzing customer feedback and providing actionable insights.

1. Research Phase

Objective
    To lay the foundation for the project by defining the problem, identifying potential solutions, and selecting suitable technologies.
    
    Understanding the Problem:
        •Analyzed existing customer feedback systems to identify limitations in current review analysis tools.
        • Studied the significance of customer sentiments and personality traits in influencing purchasing decisions.
        •Literature Review:
        •Researched academic papers and industry reports on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis techniques.
        •Explored machine learning methodologies for text classification and sentiment prediction.

    Technology Selection:
        •Chose Python for its extensive libraries, including:
        •Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
        •Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
        •Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualizing data and results.
    
2. Design Phase

Objective
    To create blueprints for the system that ensure modularity, scalability, and user-friendliness.
 
    High-Level Architecture:
        •Designed a modular architecture consisting of three main components:
        •Parsing Module: Extracts structured information from customer reviews.
        •Prediction Module: Analyzes sentiments and predicts personality traits based on review content.
        •Visualization Module: Displays results using various visualization techniques, including radar charts and bar graphs.
